We have released the pre-alpha ([v0.1-alpha](https://github.com/abyvinod/SReachTools/tree/v0.1-alpha)) version of the SReachTools (Stochastic
Reachability Tools) Toolbox! The codes and functionality have been tested
internally by Abraham and myself, but we do expect bugs to be present. 

Please help us out: if you use the code and find a bug, create an
[issue](https://github.com/abyvinod/SReachTools/issues) so we know what needs
to be fixed. If you would like to fix the bug yourself, please check out our 
[contributing](/contributing) page.

We will continue to make changes to the code over the next month in preparation
for the beta release (expected in late July).
