We have released v0.1 of the SReachTools (Stochastic Reachability Tools)
Toolbox! This is a pre-alpha release. The codes and functionality have been
tested internally by Abraham and myself, but we do expect bugs to be present. 

Please help us out: if you use the code and find a bug, create an
[issue](https://github.com/abyvinod/SReachTools/issues) so we know what needs
to be fixed. If you would like to fix the bug yourself, please check out our 
[contributing](/contributing) page.

We will continue to make changes to the code over the next month in preparation
for the beta release (expected in late July).
