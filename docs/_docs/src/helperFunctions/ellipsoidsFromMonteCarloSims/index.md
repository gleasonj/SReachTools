  Get/plot (minimum volume) ellispoids corresponding to a Monte-Carlo simulation
  ============================================================================
  
  Computes the Lowner-John ellipsoid (Boyd and Vandenberghe, Convex
  Optimization, Ch. 8.4.1) that fits the set of samples at each time instant in
  the trajectory. This function is typically useful in conjunction with
  generateMonteCarloSims to understand the spread of the Monte-Carlo simulated
  trajectories.
