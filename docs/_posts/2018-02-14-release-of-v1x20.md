## New Feature Breakdown

We've added a lot of new features to SReachTools over the past few months in
preparation for its public submission and debut at the 2019, International 
Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, coming up this April.
We will highlight some of specific feature updates here. For a more complete
listing of feature updates see the [update list](#comprehensive-feature-update-list)
below.

### Stochastic Reachability Problem Functions

Most important to the new features is the addition of four new functions for
solving different aspects of the reachability problem: point-based simulations,
set-based simulations, forward reachability calculations, and dynamic programming
solutions. In the subsequent sections we will describe each function in more 
detail. For demonstrations of how to use each of these function please see
our [examples]({{ "/examples/" | relative_url }}).

#### \# `SReachPoint`

The new function `SReachPoint` is designed to solve the problem of determining
the maximal reach probability for a target tube from a given initial state and 
synthesize a controller which provides this likelihood. Depending on the solution
method it can synthesize either open loop or affine feedback controllers. There
are five available solution methods

- `chance-open` --- Obtain a guaranteed underapproxmiation of the maximal
  reach probability using convex chance constraint methods and search for an
  open-loop control policy
- `chance-affine` --- Obtain a guaranteed underapproxmiation of the maximal
  reach probability using convex chance constraint methods and search for an
  affine feedback control policy.
- `genzps-open` --- Approximate the maximum reach probability up to a 
  user-specified tolerance level and determine the optimal open-loop controller
  that achieves this likelihood.
- `particle-open` --- Approximate the maximum reach probability using particle
  generation (Monte Carlo) methods. The quality of the approximation is proportional
  to the number of particles used. Also determines an open-loop controller which
  achieves this probability.
- `voronoi-open` --- [[ I don't know how to describe this one. :shrug: ]]

#### \# `SReachSet`

#### \# `SReachFwd`

#### \# `SReachDynProg`
