about: Suggest an idea for this toolbox

** Is your feature request a paper you published on stochastic reachability?**
We would love to incorporate more of the tools developed in the verification community into the toolbox. Please send us a link to your peer-reviewed paper, and any implementations that you may have using SReachTools. We can also proceed via a pull request, if you prefer.

**Is your feature request a modification to the existing framework in place for SReachTools?**
Please provide a clear and concise description of what you wish you to change, along with suggestions of how you think we can achieve these changes.
