% Stochastic Reachability Toolbox (SReachTools)
% Version 0.2 (R2017a) 31-May-2018
% 
% The Stochastic Reachability Toolbox (SReachTools) is an open-source MATLAB 
% toolbox for performing stochastic verification and reachability analysis.

%
% Basic Functionality:
%     - Lagrangian methods for computing approximations of the stochastic 
%       reach-avoid set
%     - Fourier transform methods for fast, high-dimensional computation of
%       reach-avoid sets using open-loop controllers
%     - Dynamic programming methods for 'exact' computation of the reach-avoid
%       probability using backward recursion
