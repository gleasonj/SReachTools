# Stochastic reachability toolbox (SReachTools)

SReachTools is a MATLAB toolbox to tackle various problems in stochastic reachability.

This is an area of active research, and this toolbox will attempt to cater
certain classes of problems. We aim to support the following problems:
 - **Stochastic reach-avoid problem** (guaranteeing safety for stochastic
   systems)
    - Lagrangian methods-based underapproximation
    - Fourier transforms-based underapproximation
 - **Forward stochastic reachability** (characterizing the stochasticity of the
   state at a future time of interest)

## Installation, documentation, and examples

`examples/*.pdf` for the PDF version of various examples run using SReach.
