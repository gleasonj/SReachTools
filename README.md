# Stochastic optimal control toolbox (SReach)

SReach is a MATLAB toolbox to tackle various problems in stochastic optimal
control with emphasis on safety.

This is an area of active research, and this toolbox will attempt to cater
certain classes of problems. We aim to support the following problems:
 - [ ] **Stochastic reach-avoid problem** (guaranteeing safety for stochastic
   systems)
    - [ ] Lagrangian methods-based underapproximation
    - [ ] Fourier transforms-based underapproximation
